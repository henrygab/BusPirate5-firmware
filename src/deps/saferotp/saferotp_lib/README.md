# SaferOTP library for RP2350

## Purpose

The one-time programmable fuses on the Raspberry Pi RP2350 chip
provides a great deal of flexibility.  The design has some nice
features, such as built-in multiple ways to store redundant data.

## Problems

These can allow additional errors to sneak through.

* ECC algorithm in the datasheet was underspecified.
* Bootrom does not normally report errors when reading ECC data.
  * When using guarded reads, a bus fault is reported for ECC errors;
    While important for security-critical boot, to not normally
    report ECC decoding errors is a poor design choice.  Moreover,
    there is no well-defined method for handling bus faults caused
    by a library's code.
  * Bootrom does not validate that decoded ECC data (if it detected
    correctable errors) actually re-encodes to the expected raw data.
    This lets 3-bit and 5-bit errors slip through(!).
* Memory-mapped OTP regions normally fail to provide any
  error reporting for invalidly-encoded / corrupt data.
  * Same problem as above ... the bootrom appears to be calling
    into the Synopsys IP block, rather than implementing the ECC
    checks itself.
  * The memory-mapped regions are thus also likely using the same
    undocumented Synopsys IP block, and has the same problems as
    calling into the bootrom functions.

Development for mere mortals can be expensive, as any
mistake may make the board unusable (one-time programmable).
Alternatively, development becomes very slow work, as each
instruction must be carefully tested.

Having a set of well-tested higher-level APIs can greatly
reduce this burden.

## Complexity

* There are many ways data could be encoded:
  * `RAW` ... 24 bits per row, without any redundancy or ECC
  * `RBIT3` ... Storing the same 24 bits of data on three rows;
    Reads use per-bit majority voting to determine set bits
    (2 of 3 majority voting)
  * `RBIT8` ... Storing the same 24 bits of data on eight rows;
    Reads use per-bit majority voting to determine set bits
    (3 of 8 majority voting)
  * `BYTE3` ... Storing a the same 8 bits in a row three times;
    Reads use per-bit majority voting to determine set bits
    (2 of 3 majority voting)
  * `ECC` ... Storing 16 bits of usable data in a row, with
    the ability to correct any single-bit error, and detect
    any two-bit error via six ECC bits.  The final two bits
    (BRBP) allow a sector with any single bit flipped to still
    be usable to store an arbitrary value by indicating that
    all the 22 remaining bits should be inverted prior to
    performing error correction/detection.

Unfortunately, not only is it non-trivial to use for common tasks,
the Error Correction that the BIOS applies does not always do
what is expected.  For example, when an OTP row has ECC encoded
data, and multiple bits are flipped (e.g., forcing errors in the
encoded data), the BIOS may improperly return incorrect data.

In addition, when reading an OTP row with ECC encoded data, the
API appears to require reading **_TWO_** rows at a time.  The
datasheet says it will return 0xFFFFFFFF on a failure.
Since the API reads two rows at a time, it cannot indicate which
of the two rows had correct data (if any).  Moreover, it appears
that the bootrom might NOT report ECC errors ... perhaps
0xFFFFFFFF is only returned on permission errors?

As for the bit-by-bit voting ... That's template code that is
not glamorous, and requires great care to implement correctly.
Without simple, tested helper APIs, many projects may choose to
ignore the edge cases, or read only one copy ... effectively
losing all redundancy.

## API

Byte-count oriented for all encodings.  
* RAW reads and write use `uint32_t` for each row, of which
  only the least significant 24 bits contain data.
* Reading RBIT3 and RBIT8 are similar, but will read three
  (or eight) rows for each `uint32_t` and handle both errors
  and bit-by-bit majority voting.
* Writing RBIT3 and RBIT8 handle errors and edge cases,
  such as allowing the overall write to succeed, even when
  some bits across those rows are faulty (e.g., cannot be
  set to one but should be, or already set to 1 but need to
  store zero), so long as rows will decode correctly.
* Reads and writes of BYTE3 use `uint8_t` for each row,
  otherwise similarto RBIT3 / RBIT8
* Reads and writes of ECC data returns `uint16_t` for each row.


## Stretch Goals

* Virtualized OTP ... 
  * At any time, switch from interacting with the real OTP
    to interacting with a virtual copy.
  * By default, caches existing values from OTP.
  * Option to load from any other source (e.g., flash, ROM,
    config file, ...) a program desires.
  * Option to persist the current (real or) virtualized OTP
    to any other source (e.g., flash, config file, ...).

* OTP Directory Entries
  * Dynamically locate data stored in OTP
  * Add new entries to the directory
  * Increase yield for boards shipped with imperfect OTP ...
    fewer binned compared to using fixed rows
  * Directory entry type specifies how the data is encoded
    into the OTP rows (RAW, BYTE3, RBIT3, RBIT8, ECC, ...)


## Debugging

This is a static library, and so gets embedded into other projects.
However, it has rich debug outputs through macros that can be
redefined as appropriate for your system.   Tested with output
sent to Segger's RTT, sent via TinyUSB serial port, and likely
easily supporting other debug output modes, by simply defining
a few macros at the head of the file.
