// * 16 bits of ECC protected data (using the RP2350's standard ECC to correct 1-bit, detect 2-bit errors)
// *  8 bits of triple-redundant data (using a majority vote to correct each bit, aka 2-of-3 voting in a single OTP ROW)
// * Using multiple rows for N-of-M voting (e.g., boot critical fields might be recorded in eight rows...)
